## Task
Suppose that there will never be more than one character of pushback. Modify `getch` and `ungetch` accordingly.

## Steps
1. Modify the `getch` function to remove any logic that handles multiple characters of pushback. Since there will only be one character of pushback at most, simplify the implementation.
2. Modify the `ungetch` function to only handle pushing back a single character. It should no longer need to maintain a buffer for multiple characters.
3. Ensure that `ungetch` behaves correctly by storing the pushed-back character in a simple variable, without needing a larger buffer or pointer.
4. Update the `getch` function to read from the pushback character if available, and then clear the pushback character after it is used.
5. Test the new `getch` and `ungetch` functions with different input scenarios to ensure they work as expected, including when no character is pushed back and when a character is pushed back.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `getch` and `ungetch` functions should correctly handle a single character of pushback. The functions should be simplified and optimized for this case, with `ungetch` storing and pushing back only one character at a time. The behavior should be consistent and efficient for all input cases.
