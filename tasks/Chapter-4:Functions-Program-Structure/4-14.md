# Exercise 4-14: Defining a Macro to Swap Two Arguments

## Task
Define a macro `swap(t,x,y)` that interchanges two arguments of type `t`.

## Steps
1. Understand that a macro in C is a preprocessor directive that can perform simple text substitutions.
2. The goal is to create a macro that will swap two variables of any type `t`.
3. Use a temporary variable to hold one of the values during the swap, ensuring that both values are interchanged.
4. Implement the `swap` macro so that it works for any data type. This can be achieved using a block structure within the macro to limit the scope of the temporary variable used for swapping.
5. Test the macro with different types of variables (e.g., integers, floats, and characters) to ensure it works correctly for various data types.

## Expected Outcome
The `swap` macro should correctly swap the values of two variables of any type `t` by using a temporary variable inside a block structure. The swap should work for different data types, and the original values of the variables should be interchanged.
