# Exercise 4-5: Adding Access to Library Functions

## Task
Add access to library functions like `sin`, `exp`, and `pow` to the calculator. These functions are available in `<math.h>`, and should be callable from within the calculator.

## Steps
1. Include the `<math.h>` library in the calculator program to gain access to mathematical functions like `sin`, `exp`, and `pow`.
2. Modify the calculator to accept commands that correspond to these mathematical functions:
   - Implement a command to compute the sine of a number using the `sin` function.
   - Implement a command to compute the exponential value of a number using the `exp` function.
   - Implement a command to compute the power of a number using the `pow` function, requiring two operands.
3. Ensure proper parsing of the input and passing of arguments to the corresponding functions.
4. Ensure that the results of these functions are displayed correctly in the calculatorâ€™s output.
5. Handle invalid inputs or edge cases, such as incorrect numbers of operands or values outside the domain of the functions.

## Expected Outcome
The calculator should be extended to support the following library functions:
- `sin(x)` for computing the sine of `x`.
- `exp(x)` for computing the exponential of `x`.
- `pow(x, y)` for computing `x` raised to the power of `y`.

These functions should be integrated into the calculator's operation, providing accurate results for mathematical calculations involving trigonometric, exponential, and power functions.
