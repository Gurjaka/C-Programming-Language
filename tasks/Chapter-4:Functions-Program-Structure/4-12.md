## Task
Adapt the ideas of `printd` to write a recursive version of `itoa`. This version should convert an integer into a string by calling a recursive routine.

## Steps
1. Understand how `itoa` works by converting an integer into a string using iteration. The recursive version will rely on similar principles but will use recursion instead of iteration.
2. Implement a recursive function that converts the integer to a string. The base case for the recursion should handle when the number is zero, and the recursive case should reduce the problem size by dividing the number by 10.
3. In the recursive function, handle the sign of the number by checking if it's negative and appropriately adding the minus sign when necessary.
4. Build the string from the least significant digit to the most significant one. This can be done by recursively processing the digits in reverse order.
5. Once the recursive function is complete, ensure that the string is properly null-terminated and handles edge cases such as zero and negative numbers.

## Expected Outcome
The recursive `itoa` function should correctly convert an integer into a string, with each recursive call processing one digit at a time. The function should properly handle both positive and negative integers and return a correctly formatted string
