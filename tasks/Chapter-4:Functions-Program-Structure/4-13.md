# Exercise 4-13: Writing a Recursive Version of reverse

## Task
Write a recursive version of the function `reverse(s)`, which reverses the string `s` in place.

## Steps
1. Understand the basic logic for reversing a string. Typically, this involves swapping characters from both ends of the string, moving toward the center.
2. Implement a recursive function that takes a string `s` and two indices (or pointers) as arguments: one pointing to the beginning of the string and the other to the end.
3. The base case for the recursion should be when the two indices cross, at which point the string is fully reversed.
4. In the recursive step, swap the characters at the two indices, then recursively call the function with the indices moved inward (i.e., increment the start index and decrement the end index).
5. Ensure that the string is reversed in place, meaning no additional memory should be allocated for a new string.
6. Test the function with various strings, including edge cases like empty strings or strings with only one character.

## Expected Outcome
The recursive `reverse` function should successfully reverse the string in place, modifying the original string rather than creating a new one. The recursion should swap the characters step by step until the string is fully reversed.
