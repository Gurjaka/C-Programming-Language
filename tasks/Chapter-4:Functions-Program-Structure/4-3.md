# Exercise 4-3: Extending the Calculator with Modulus and Negative Numbers

## Task
Given the basic framework of a calculator, extend it to add the modulus (`%`) operator and provisions for handling negative numbers.

## Steps
1. Modify the calculator to support the modulus operator (`%`). This operator should return the remainder when one number is divided by another.
2. Ensure that the modulus operator works with both positive and negative integers, following the correct mathematical rules.
3. Add provisions for handling negative numbers, both as input and as results of operations, ensuring proper evaluation.
4. Implement the parsing of negative numbers, making sure that they are correctly identified and processed when encountered in the expression.
5. Ensure the calculator correctly evaluates expressions that contain the modulus operator and negative numbers.

## Expected Outcome
The extended calculator should be able to:
- Perform modulus operations (`%`) correctly.
- Handle negative numbers in both operands and results of operations.
- Properly evaluate and display results for expressions involving both the modulus operator and negative numbers.
