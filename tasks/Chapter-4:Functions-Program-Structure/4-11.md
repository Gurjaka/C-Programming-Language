## Task
Modify `getop` so that it doesn't need to use `ungetch`. Use an internal static variable to store the pushed-back character instead.

## Steps
1. Analyze the current implementation of `getop` and identify where it relies on `ungetch` to push characters back.
2. Replace the use of `ungetch` with an internal static variable within `getop`. This static variable will store the last pushed-back character.
3. Implement logic within `getop` to check if the internal static variable has a stored character. If it does, return that character first before reading new input.
4. If the internal static variable is empty, proceed with reading a new character from the input.
5. Ensure that once the internal static variable is used, it is reset to avoid incorrect behavior during future calls to `getop`.
6. Test the modified `getop` to ensure it correctly handles input and pushed-back characters, without requiring `ungetch`.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `getop` function should no longer need to rely on `ungetch` for pushing characters back. Instead, it should use an internal static variable to store and retrieve a pushed-back character. The function should behave correctly, with input being handled efficiently and without errors.
