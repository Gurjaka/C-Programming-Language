## Task
Extend the function `atof` to handle scientific notation of the form `1.23e-10`, where `e` or `E` indicates the power of 10. The function should be able to correctly parse numbers with exponents.

## Steps
1. Modify the `atof` function to accept and correctly interpret numbers with scientific notation.
2. Ensure the function can handle both lowercase `e` and uppercase `E` for the exponent part of the number.
3. Handle both positive and negative exponents.
4. Implement logic to parse the base (before the `e` or `E`) and the exponent (after the `e` or `E`).
5. Ensure correct handling of edge cases such as missing base or exponent parts, or invalid scientific notation formats.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `atof` function should be able to parse numbers in both regular and scientific notation, returning the correct floating-point value.
