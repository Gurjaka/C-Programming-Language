## Task
Write a routine `ungets(s)` that will push back an entire string onto the input. Consider whether `ungets` should know about `buf` and `bufp` or if it should just use `ungetch`.

## Steps
1. Implement the function `ungets(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and pushes each character of the string back onto the input.
2. Use the existing `ungetch` function, if available, to push the characters of the string onto the input buffer. 
3. Consider whether `ungets` should directly manipulate `buf` and `bufp` (the input buffer and pointer) or if it should only use `ungetch` to interact with the buffer.
4. If `ungets` uses `ungetch`, ensure that each character in the string is pushed in reverse order (as `ungetch` pushes characters onto the stack).
5. Handle any edge cases, such as when the string is too long to fit in the buffer, by considering how `ungetch` works and any potential limitations.

## Expected Outcome
The `ungets` function should correctly push back an entire string onto the input, making it available for subsequent reads. It should use the appropriate mechanism to interact with the input buffer and handle the string in a way that ensures proper functionality.
