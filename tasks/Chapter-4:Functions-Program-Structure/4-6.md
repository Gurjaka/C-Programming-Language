# Exercise 4-6: Adding Commands for Handling Variables

## Task
Add commands to the calculator for handling variables. Provide support for twenty-six variables with single-letter names (e.g., `a` to `z`). Additionally, add a variable to store the most recently printed value.

## Steps
1. Implement a mechanism to store and retrieve values for twenty-six variables, each corresponding to a single letter (`a` to `z`).
2. Implement commands to assign values to these variables. For example, `a = 5` should store the value `5` in the variable `a`.
3. Implement a command to retrieve and use the value of a variable. For example, when the calculator encounters `a`, it should return the value stored in `a`.
4. Add a special variable, such as `v`, to store the most recently printed value.
5. Ensure that after each result is printed, it is saved to the `v` variable, making it available for use in subsequent calculations.
6. Handle errors gracefully, such as trying to access a variable that has not been assigned a value yet.

## Expected Outcome
The calculator should be extended to support:
- Twenty-six variables with single-letter names (`a` to `z`).
- Storing values in these variables and retrieving them for calculations.
- A special variable (`v`) that stores the most recently printed value.
- Proper handling of variable assignments and usage within expressions.
