# Exercise 4-4: Extending the Calculator with Stack Operations

## Task
Add the following commands to the calculator:
- Print the top element of the stack without popping it.
- Duplicate the top element of the stack.
- Swap the top two elements of the stack.
- Clear the stack.

## Steps
1. Implement a command to print the top element of the stack without removing it.
2. Implement a command to duplicate the top element of the stack, adding another copy of it on top of the stack.
3. Implement a command to swap the top two elements of the stack.
4. Implement a command to clear the entire stack, removing all elements from it.
5. Ensure that each of these commands works correctly within the calculator's operation and that the stack state is properly updated.

## Expected Outcome
The calculator should be extended to:
- Print the top element of the stack without modifying it.
- Duplicate the top element.
- Swap the top two elements.
- Clear the entire stack.

These commands should be properly integrated into the calculator's existing functionality.
