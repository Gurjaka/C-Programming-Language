# Exercise 4-9: Handling Pushed-Back EOF in getch and ungetch

## Task
The current implementations of `getch` and `ungetch` do not handle a pushed-back EOF correctly. Decide what their properties should be when an EOF is pushed back, and then implement your design.

## Steps
1. Analyze the current behavior of `getch` and `ungetch` with regard to EOF. In typical implementations, EOF is represented by `-1` or another special value.
2. Decide how EOF should be handled when pushed back onto the input buffer. Consider the following options:
   - Should `ungetch` allow EOF to be pushed back?
   - Should `getch` treat pushed-back EOF as a valid input or handle it differently?
3. Modify the `ungetch` function to handle pushing back an EOF correctly. For instance, if EOF is pushed back, `ungetch` should ensure that the pushed-back EOF is correctly handled and returned by `getch` when requested.
4. Modify the `getch` function to correctly process a pushed-back EOF. It should recognize when EOF has been pushed back and return it when appropriate.
5. Implement any necessary checks or flags to ensure that the behavior of `getch` and `ungetch` is consistent with the expected handling of EOF in the input stream.

## Expected Outcome
The `getch` and `ungetch` functions should be modified to correctly handle EOF when it is pushed back onto the input. The behavior should ensure that EOF can be pushed back and retrieved from the input buffer as expected, without causing incorrect behavior or errors.
