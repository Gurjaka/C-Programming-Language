## Task
An alternate organization uses `getline` to read an entire input line; this makes `getch` and `ungetch` unnecessary. Revise the calculator to use `getline` for input instead of `getch` and `ungetch`.

## Steps
1. Replace the usage of `getch` and `ungetch` with `getline` to read entire lines of input. 
2. Modify the input parsing logic to handle input as a complete line, instead of reading one character at a time.
3. Ensure that `getline` can properly read input of varying lengths, handling large inputs and input with spaces correctly.
4. Update the tokenizer or expression parsing logic to work with entire lines of input rather than processing characters individually.
5. Remove any code related to managing a character buffer (e.g., `buf` and `bufp`) that was previously used with `getch` and `ungetch`.
6. Test the modified calculator to ensure it behaves correctly with this new input handling approach, including handling different input sizes and formats.

## Expected Outcome
The calculator should function correctly with `getline` used to read entire input lines. It should no longer rely on `getch` and `ungetch`, and the logic should be updated to handle complete lines of input. The calculator should properly parse and evaluate expressions from the input lines.
