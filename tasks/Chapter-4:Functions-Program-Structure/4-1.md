# Exercise 4-1: Implementing strindex to Find the Rightmost Occurrence

## Task
Write the function `strindex(s, t)` which returns the position of the rightmost occurrence of the string `t` in the string `s`, or `-1` if there is none.

## Steps
1. Implement the function `strindex` that takes two string arguments, `s` and `t`.
2. Search for the rightmost occurrence of string `t` in string `s`.
3. Return the position (index) of the first character of the rightmost occurrence of `t` in `s`. If `t` does not exist in `s`, return `-1`.
4. Ensure that the function works for all valid input strings, including edge cases where `t` is empty or not found.

## Expected Outcome
The function `strindex` should correctly return the index of the rightmost occurrence of `t` in `s`, or `-1` if `t` is not found.
