## ðŸ“˜ Exercise 6-2 â€” Grouping C Variable Names

**Goal:**  
Write a C program that reads a C source file and **groups variable names** that are **identical in the first _N_ characters**, but differ after that. Print each group in **alphabetical order**.

**Details:**
- _N_ is a parameter set via the **command line**.
- **Ignore** words inside:
  - String literals
  - Single-line (`//`)
  - Multi-line (`/* */`) comments

**Example:**  
With `N = 6`, the names `sampleRate`, `sampleSize`, and `sampleCount` would be grouped under `sample`.

**Hints:**
- Use a tree or hash map for grouping.
- Properly tokenize input to skip comments and strings.
