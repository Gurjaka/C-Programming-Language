# 📘 Exercise 6-3: Cross-Referencer

## 🧠 Objective

Write a program that reads a document, prints all significant words in **alphabetical order**, and for each word, shows the **line numbers** where it appears.

## ✅ Features

- Ignore **noise words** (e.g. `the`, `and`, `in`, etc.)
- Track and store **unique words**
- Associate each word with a list of **line numbers**
- Print the result in **sorted order**

## 🧩 Implementation Plan

1. **Read Input**  
   - Line by line, word by word  
   - Track current line number  

2. **Filter Noise Words**  
   - Use a fixed array of common words to skip  

3. **Store Words**  
   - Use a **binary search tree**:  
     - Node = word + dynamic array of line numbers  
     - Skip duplicate line entries for the same word  

4. **Print Output**  
   - In-order traversal of BST  
   - Print each word with its line numbers

## 📝 Example Output

```
barked: 3  
dog: 2 3  
fox: 1  
jumps: 2  
lazy: 2  
...
```
