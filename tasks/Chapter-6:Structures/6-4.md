## 📝 Exercise 6-4 – Word Frequency Counter

### 🎯 Goal
Write a program that:
- Counts word frequencies from input.
- Prints each word and its count, sorted by frequency (highest first).

---

### 📥 Input
- Words are alphabetic characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`).
- Non-alphabetic characters separate words.

---

### 📤 Output
- List words, each preceded by its count, sorted by frequency.

Example:
```
10 the  
8 and  
4 quick  
3 fox  
```

---

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Use a binary search tree (BST) or hash table to track word counts.
- After collecting words, **sort** by frequency (use `qsort()`).

---

### 🚧 Hints
- Use `getword()` for word parsing.
- Implement a `compare_count()` function for sorting.
