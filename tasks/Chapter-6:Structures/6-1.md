## ðŸ§  Exercise 6-1 â€“ Improving `getword`
---
The current implementation of `getword` from earlier chapters in *The C Programming Language* (K&R) doesn't correctly handle several important elements in C source code:

- **Underscores (`_`)** in identifiers (e.g., `my_variable`)
- **String constants** (e.g., `"hello world"`)
- **Comments** (both `/* block comments */` and `// line comments`)
- **Preprocessor directives** (e.g., `#include`, `#define`)
---
### ðŸ”§ Task
---

Write an improved version of `getword` that correctly handles:

- Identifiers that include underscores.
- String literals enclosed in double quotes.
- Skipping over comments entirely.
- Recognizing and ignoring preprocessor control lines.

This updated `getword` should be more robust for analyzing or parsing real-world C source code.
