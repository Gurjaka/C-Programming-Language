# Exercise 6-6: Implement a Simple Version of the `#define` Processor

## Description

Implement a simple version of the `#define` processor (i.e., no arguments) suitable for use with C programs. The processor should be based on the routines covered in this section of the book. You may find `getch` and `ungetch` helpful in implementing this task.

## Steps

1. **Define the basic structure**:
   - Create a symbol table to store the `#define` macros.
   - Write a function to process `#define` directives and add them to the symbol table.
   
2. **Handle the input**:
   - Use `getch` and `ungetch` to manage reading characters one at a time from the input stream.
   
3. **Process `#define` directives**:
   - When a `#define` directive is encountered, extract the macro name and its replacement text.
   - Store the macro name and its associated text in the symbol table.

4. **Substitute defined macros**:
   - For each line in the input, check if any of the defined macros are present and substitute them with their defined value.

5. **Edge cases**:
   - Handle cases where there are no `#define` macros.
   - Ensure that no unwanted macros are processed.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the processor with various C source files that include `#define` macros, checking that macros are correctly substituted.

## Resources
- The `getch` and `ungetch` functions as discussed in the book may be useful for reading characters from the input stream.
