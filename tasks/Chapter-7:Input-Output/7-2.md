# Exercise 7-2 — C Programming Language (K&R2)

## Task

Write a C program that reads **arbitrary input** and prints it in a **sensible** and **readable** way.

### Minimum Requirements

- Print **non-graphic characters** (i.e. control characters, non-printables) in **octal** or **hexadecimal** format, depending on local convention.
- **Break long lines** of text to keep output readable.

### Notes

- "Graphic characters" are typically printable characters with a visual representation (e.g. ASCII 32–126).
- "Non-graphic characters" include things like newlines, tabs, control codes (ASCII < 32 or > 126).
- Use `isgraph()` or `isprint()` from `<ctype.h>` to check if a character is printable.
- Use escape sequences like `\n`, `\t` for common control characters, and fallback to hex (e.g. `\x1B`) or octal (e.g. `\033`) for others.
- For line-breaking, you can wrap lines after a certain length (e.g., 80 columns).

### Example

**Input (invisible control characters included):**
```
Hello␉World␊SomeBinary␛Junk
```

**Output (sensible printable version):**
```
Hello\tWorld\nSomeBinary\x1BJunk
```
