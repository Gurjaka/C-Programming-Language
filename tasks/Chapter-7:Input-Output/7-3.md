# Exercise 7-3

## Task

Revise `minprintf` to handle more of the other facilities of `printf`.

## Objective

Extend the functionality of the `minprintf` function from Chapter 7 of *The C Programming Language (K&R)* to support more format specifiers and flags, closer to the standard `printf` behavior.

## Requirements

- Add support for additional format specifiers such as:
  - `%o`, `%x`, `%X`, `%u`, `%c`, `%e`, `%g`, etc.
- Handle flags like:
  - `-` (left justify), `+` (sign), `0` (zero-padding), `#` (alternate form), and space.
- Optionally support field width and precision (e.g., `%10.2f`).

## Notes

This task is meant to deepen understanding of variadic functions, format parsing, and output formatting in C.
