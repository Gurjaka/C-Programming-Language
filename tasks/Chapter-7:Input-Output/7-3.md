## Exercise 7-3 â€” The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition

Revise the `minprintf` function from Chapter 7 to support more of the formatting capabilities of the standard `printf` function. The original `minprintf` handles only a limited set of conversion specifiers (like `%d`, `%f`, `%s`, etc.) and minimal flag support.

Your task is to improve it so it can interpret and pass along additional format specifiers and flags, such as:

- Field width and precision (e.g., `%6.2f`)
- Left-justification (`%-d`)
- Zero-padding (`%05d`)
- Alternate form (`%#x`, `%#o`)
- Signs (`%+d`, `% d`)

### Notes

- The goal is not to reimplement `printf` but to parse the format string more fully and correctly pass the format and corresponding argument to `printf`.
- Use <stdarg.h> for handling the variable arguments, as shown in the original `minprintf`.
- Test with a variety of format strings to ensure your implementation works correctly.

### Deliverables

- An updated `minprintf` function in C
- Example usage that demonstrates the supported features
