## Exercise 7-6

### Task

Write a program to compare two files, printing the first line where they differ.

### Objective

Build a file comparison tool that mimics basic `diff` behavior: scan two input files line-by-line and print the first line where the contents differ.

### Requirements

- Read two files simultaneously.
- Compare them line by line.
- Print both lines at the first point of difference, along with the line number.
- Handle end-of-file conditions gracefully (e.g., one file is longer).

---

### Notes

These exercises aim to build a solid foundation in:
- I/O with variadic functions
- String parsing with `scanf`/`sscanf`
- File operations (`fopen`, `fgets`, etc.)
- Robust input validation and comparison logic
