## Exercise 7-5

### Task

Rewrite the postfix calculator of Chapter 4 to use `scanf` and/or `sscanf` to do the input and number conversion.

### Objective

Update the existing Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator implementation to replace manual parsing (e.g., `getop` and `atof`) with standard input functions like `scanf` or `sscanf`.

### Requirements

- Use `scanf` or `sscanf` to read and interpret tokens from input.
- Simplify or replace the custom logic used in `getop`.
- Ensure correct behavior with numbers, operators, and error handling.
- Maintain functionality of the stack-based calculator.

### Notes

These exercises are designed to deepen your understanding of:
- Variadic functions
- Format string parsing
- Standard I/O handling (`printf`, `scanf`, `sscanf`)
- Modular program design and input processing in C
