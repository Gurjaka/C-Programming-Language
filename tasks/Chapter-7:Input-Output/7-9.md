# Exercise 7-9 â€“ K&R

## Task

Functions like `isupper` can be implemented to save space or to save time. Explore both possibilities.

## Objective

Compare and implement two different versions of the `isupper` function:
- One that optimizes for **space**
- One that optimizes for **time**

Analyze trade-offs between the two approaches in terms of efficiency and memory usage.

## Requirements

- Implement a space-efficient version of `isupper`, likely using logical/relational expressions.
- Implement a time-efficient version, possibly using a lookup table or macro.
- Test both versions with various inputs to ensure correctness.
- Measure or reason about the trade-offs:
  - Memory footprint
  - Execution speed
  - Code clarity

## Optional

- Extend the analysis to other character classification functions like `islower`, `isdigit`, etc.
- Use profiling tools to get actual performance metrics (if possible).

## Notes

This task sharpens:
- Your understanding of trade-offs in systems programming
- Macro vs. function use
- Lookup table design
- Bit-level and range-based logic in C
