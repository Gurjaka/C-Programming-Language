# Exercise 7-8 â€“ K&R

## Task

Write a program to print a set of files, starting each new one on a new page, with a title and a running page count for each file.

## Objective

Create a file-printing utility that formats output into paginated sections. Each file should start on a new page with a clear title header and per-file page numbering.

## Requirements

- Accept multiple file names as command-line arguments.
- Print the contents of each file:
  - Begin each file on a new page.
  - Display the file name as the title on top of the page.
  - Show a running page number for each file (e.g., `Page 1`, `Page 2`, etc.).
- Assume a fixed number of lines per page (e.g., 60).
- Insert form feeds (`\f`) or appropriate spacing between pages if targeting plain output.

## Optional

- Allow customization of lines per page via command-line option (e.g., `-l 40`).
- Include current date/time in the header.
- Align titles and page numbers for readability.

## Notes

This task builds experience with:
- File I/O (`fopen`, `fgets`, etc.)
- Formatting output with headers and pagination
- Managing line counts and page transitions
- Command-line argument parsing
