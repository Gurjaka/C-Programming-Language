# Exercise 7-7 â€“ K&R

## Task

Modify the pattern-finding program from Chapter 5 to take its input from a set of named files or, if no files are provided as arguments, from standard input. Decide whether the filename should be printed when a matching line is found.

## Objective

Enhance the original pattern search program (`find` or similar) to support multiple file inputs and standard input fallback, mimicking basic `grep` behavior.

## Requirements

- Accept multiple file names as command-line arguments.
- If no file names are given, read from `stdin`.
- For each line that matches the pattern:
  - Print the line.
  - Optionally, include the file name in the output for clarity.
- Handle file opening and closing robustly.
- Provide appropriate error messages if a file cannot be opened.

## Optional

- Use a command-line flag (e.g. `-f`) to control whether filenames are shown in output.
- Support case-insensitive matching (`-i`).

## Notes

This task reinforces:
- File handling via `fopen`, `fgets`, `fclose`
- Command-line argument parsing
- Modular program design
