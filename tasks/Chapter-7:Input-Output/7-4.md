## Exercise 7-4

### Task

Write a private version of `scanf` analogous to `minprintf` from the previous section.

### Objective

Implement a simplified version of `scanf`, named something like `minscanf`, that can interpret a format string and store values in provided variables, similar to how `scanf` works.

### Requirements

- Use variadic functions to parse arguments.
- Handle basic format specifiers like:
  - `%d`, `%f`, `%s`, `%c`
- Read from `stdin` and store user input into the appropriate variables.
- Keep parsing and logic modular and robust.

---

### Notes

These exercises help build a deeper understanding of:
- Format string parsing
- Variadic argument handling
- Input/output mechanisms in C
