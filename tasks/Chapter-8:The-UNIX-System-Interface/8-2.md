## Exercise 8-2

### Task

Rewrite `fopen` and `_fillbuf` using **fields** (struct fields or flags) instead of explicit bit operations. Compare code size and execution speed.

### Objective

Refactor the internal buffering implementation of the standard I/O system in C to improve clarity by replacing bitmask flag checks with dedicated struct fields.

### Requirements

- Replace bitwise flag logic (e.g. `if ((fp->flag & _READ) == 0)`) with clear struct fields (e.g. `fp->readable`).
- Refactor both `fopen` and `_fillbuf` accordingly.
- Maintain functionality and correctness of the I/O system.
- Compare:
  - Code size (lines of code, binary size)
  - Execution performance (with test programs)
