## Exercise 8-6

### Task

The standard library function `calloc(n, size)` returns a pointer to `n` objects of `size` bytes, with the storage initialized to zero. Write `calloc` by calling `malloc` or by modifying it.

### Objective

Implement the `calloc` function from scratch by either modifying or calling `malloc`, ensuring it initializes memory to zero.

### Requirements

- Implement `calloc(n, size)` using `malloc`:
  - Use `malloc` to allocate memory for `n` objects, each of size `size`.
  - Initialize the allocated memory to zero.
  - Return a pointer to the allocated block of memory.
- Ensure proper error handling if memory allocation fails.

### Notes

- You can use `memset` or equivalent methods to initialize the allocated memory to zero.
- This task helps understand how `calloc` works internally.
