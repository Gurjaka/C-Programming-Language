## Exercise 8-4

### Task

The standard library function `fseek` can be implemented in terms of `lseek`. Write `fseek` and `ftell` for a custom file structure.

### Objective

Re-implement `fseek` and `ftell` using lower-level system calls (such as `lseek` for seeking file descriptors), and adapt them for custom file handling.

### Requirements

- Implement `fseek` to move the file position indicator to a specified location in the file.
- Implement `ftell` to return the current file position.
- Ensure both functions interact with your file structure and perform correctly.
- Handle edge cases:
  - Negative offsets
  - Moving beyond file boundaries
- If applicable, use `lseek` system call to optimize the file positioning logic.

## Notes

These exercises focus on:
- File descriptor manipulation using low-level system calls (`lseek`)
- Implementing higher-level abstractions like `fseek` and `ftell`
- Understanding file offsets and seeking in low-level I/O systems
