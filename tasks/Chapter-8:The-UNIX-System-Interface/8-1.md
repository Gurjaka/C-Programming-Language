# Exercise 8-1 â€“ K&R

## Task

Rewrite the `cat` program from Chapter 7 using low-level system calls: `read`, `write`, `open`, and `close` instead of their standard library equivalents (`fopen`, `fgets`, `fputs`, etc.). Perform experiments to compare the performance of both versions.

## Objective

Gain hands-on experience with low-level UNIX system calls for file I/O and compare them with standard C library functions in terms of performance and implementation simplicity.

## Requirements

- Implement a new version of `cat` that:
  - Uses `open` to open input files
  - Uses `read` to read file contents
  - Uses `write` to output to `stdout`
  - Uses `close` to release file descriptors
- Support reading from one or more files passed as command-line arguments.
- If no arguments are provided, read from standard input.
- Compare this version against the original standard I/O version in:
  - Runtime speed
  - Simplicity and code clarity

## Optional

- Use `gettimeofday`, `clock_gettime`, or `time` to benchmark both versions.
- Allow block size configuration via command-line for tuning `read`/`write` performance.
- Handle errors gracefully for all system calls.

## Notes

This task teaches:
- UNIX-style file descriptor I/O
- Buffer management and performance tuning
- How abstraction layers (like stdio) affect performance and portability
