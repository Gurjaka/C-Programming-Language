## Exercise 8-7

### Task

`malloc` accepts a size request without checking its plausibility; `free` believes that the block it is asked to free contains a valid size field. Improve these routines so they make more efforts with error checking.

### Objective

Enhance `malloc` and `free` to improve error checking and ensure the integrity of memory management.

### Requirements

- Modify `malloc` to:
  - Check that the requested memory size is reasonable (non-negative and not excessively large).
  - Ensure that the requested memory size is a multiple of the system's word size (if applicable).
- Modify `free` to:
  - Check that the pointer being freed is valid (e.g., not `NULL` and within the allocated region).
  - Verify that the memory block contains a valid size field or metadata.

### Notes

- This task is important for understanding how memory corruption can occur and how to prevent it.
- You might need to introduce additional metadata for each allocated block (e.g., storing the size before the memory block).
