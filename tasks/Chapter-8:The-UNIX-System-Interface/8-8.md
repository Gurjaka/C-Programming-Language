## Exercise 8-8

### Task

Write a routine `bfree(p, n)` that will free any arbitrary block `p` of `n` characters into the free list maintained by `malloc` and `free`. By using `bfree`, a user can add a static or external array to the free list at any time.

### Objective

Implement the `bfree(p, n)` function, which allows freeing arbitrary blocks of memory (not just those allocated by `malloc`), by adding them to the free list.

### Requirements

- Implement `bfree(p, n)` to:
  - Accept a pointer `p` and the number of bytes `n` in the block.
  - Add this block to the free list of memory managed by the custom allocator.
- Ensure proper error handling and consistency with the existing `malloc`/`free` logic.

### Notes

- This task is useful for understanding how to manage memory beyond just using `malloc` and `free`.
- `bfree` might be useful for managing statically allocated memory or memory from external sources.
- Be cautious of memory fragmentation and maintaining a consistent free list.

## Notes

These exercises focus on:
- Memory allocation and error handling in custom memory management routines
- Improving the robustness of `malloc` and `free`
- Managing memory beyond just dynamically allocated blocks
