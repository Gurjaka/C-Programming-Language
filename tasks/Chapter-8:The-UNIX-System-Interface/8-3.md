## Exercise 8-3

### Task

Design and write the functions: `_flushbuf`, `fflush`, and `fclose`.

### Objective

Implement output-buffering support and cleanup logic for your custom file structure or standard I/O system model, completing the I/O pipeline with proper flushing and closure.

### Requirements

- Implement `_flushbuf` to flush the buffer of a `FILE` object to the file descriptor.
- Implement `fflush` to flush:
  - A specific `FILE *` object
  - All open output streams if passed `NULL`
- Implement `fclose` to:
  - Flush any remaining output using `fflush`
  - Close the file descriptor
  - Free or reset the associated structure

### Notes

Ensure proper error checking and handling in all functions.
