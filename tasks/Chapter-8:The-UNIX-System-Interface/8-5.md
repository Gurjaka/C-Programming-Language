# Exercise 8-5 â€“ K&R

## Task

Modify the `fsize` program to print the other information contained in the inode entry.

## Objective

Extend the functionality of the `fsize` program to display additional information from the inode structure, beyond just the file size.

## Requirements

- Modify the existing `fsize` program to use system calls like `stat` or `fstat` to retrieve the inode information.
- Print the following information about the file (from the inode):
  - File size (already implemented)
  - File permissions (e.g., read, write, execute for user, group, and others)
  - File type (regular file, directory, symbolic link, etc.)
  - Last access time (atime)
  - Last modification time (mtime)
  - Last status change time (ctime)
- Ensure proper error checking and handling for missing or inaccessible files.
  
### Notes

- Use `stat()` or `fstat()` system calls to access the inode information.
- Format the printed data in a human-readable way, similar to how `ls -l` outputs file details.

## Notes

This task reinforces:
- Working with file metadata and inodes
- Understanding file permissions and time attributes
- Using `stat`/`fstat` system calls to retrieve file details
- File descriptor management and error handling
