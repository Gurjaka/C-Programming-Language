# Exercise 2-6

Write a function `setbits(x, p, n, y)` that modifies `x` by replacing `n` bits,  
starting from position `p`, with the rightmost `n` bits of `y`. The rest of the bits  
in `x` should remain unchanged.

## Parameters:
- `x`: The original integer whose bits will be modified.
- `p`: The position (0-based from the right) where the replacement starts.
- `n`: The number of bits to replace.
- `y`: The integer providing the new bits (only the rightmost `n` bits of `y` are used).

## Expected Behavior:
- Extract the rightmost `n` bits from `y`.
- Replace `n` bits in `x`, starting from position `p`, with these extracted bits.
- Keep all other bits in `x` unchanged.

## Example:
```c
setbits(0b10101010, 4, 3, 0b11001100)
```
