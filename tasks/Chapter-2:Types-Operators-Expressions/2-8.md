# **Exercise 2-8: Right Rotate**

**Write a function `rightrot(x, n)` that returns the value of the integer `x` rotated to the right by `n` positions.**

## **Steps:**

1. **Extract the bits that will be rotated out**: These are the rightmost `n` bits of `x`.
2. **Shift `x` to the right by `n` positions**.
3. **Bring the shifted-out bits to the leftmost positions** and combine them with the shifted value.
