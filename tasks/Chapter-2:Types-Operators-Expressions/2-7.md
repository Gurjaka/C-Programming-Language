# Exercise 2-7: Invert n Bits in x

## Write a function invert(x, p, n) that inverts n bits starting at position p in the number x. The other bits should remain unchanged.

**Steps:**
- Create a mask with n bits set to 1 at position p.
- Invert the n bits of x using the XOR (^) operator with the mask.
