# Task: Implement the `any` Function

## Objective

**Write a function named `any` that takes two strings, `s1` and `s2`, and returns the first location in `s1` where any character from `s2` occurs. If `s1` contains no characters from `s2`, the function should return `-1`.**

## Function Signature

```c
int any(char s1[], char s2[]);
```
