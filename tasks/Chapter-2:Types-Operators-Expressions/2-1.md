## Exercise 2-1: Determining the Ranges of Data Types

### Goal: Write a program to determine the ranges of `char`, `short`, `int`, and `long` variables, both signed and unsigned, by printing appropriate values from standard headers and by direct computation. The task becomes more challenging if you compute the ranges yourself. Additionally, determine the ranges of the various floating-point types.
