## Task
In two's complement representation, the standard `itoa` function fails for the most negative number (`-(2^(wordsize-1))`). This happens because negating this value exceeds the range of positive numbers representable in the same number of bits.

Modify `itoa` to correctly handle this edge case on any machine.

## Steps
1. Identify why `itoa` fails for the largest negative number.
2. Implement a fix that works across different word sizes.
3. Ensure correctness by testing with various inputs, including the edge case.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `itoa` function should correctly convert the most negative number to a string representation, regardless of system architecture.
