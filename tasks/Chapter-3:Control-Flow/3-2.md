# Exercise 3-2: Escape and Unescape Functions

## Task
Write a function `escape(s, t)` that converts special characters (e.g., newline, tab) in `t` into visible escape sequences (e.g., `\n`, `\t`) and stores the result in `s`. Use a `switch` statement.

Write another function to perform the reverse operation, converting escape sequences back into their actual characters.

## Steps
1. Implement `escape(s, t)` using a `switch` statement.
2. Implement the reverse function.
3. Test both functions with various input cases.

## Expected Outcome
The functions should correctly transform strings between escaped and unescaped representations.
