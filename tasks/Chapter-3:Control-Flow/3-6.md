## Task
Write a version of `itoa` that accepts three arguments instead of two. The third argument is a minimum field width; the converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary to make it wide enough.

## Steps
1. Modify the `itoa` function to accept three arguments: the integer `n`, the character array `s`, and the minimum field width `width`.
2. Implement the logic to convert the integer `n` into a string representation.
3. Ensure that the string is padded with blank spaces on the left if its length is less than the specified minimum field width `width`.
4. Handle both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that negative values are represented correctly and the padding does not overwrite the negative sign.
5. Ensure that the converted string is null-terminated.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `itoa` function should correctly convert the integer `n` into a string, ensuring that if the converted number is shorter than the specified field width, it is padded with blank spaces on the left.
