## Task
Write the function `itob(n, s, b)` that converts the integer `n` into a base `b` character representation in the string `s`. In particular, `itob(n, s, 16)` should format `s` as a hexadecimal integer in `s`.

## Steps
1. Identify the logic needed to convert an integer `n` into a string representation in a given base `b`.
2. Implement the conversion for bases 2 through 16, mapping numbers to the correct characters (`0-9` for digits and `a-f` for hexadecimal).
3. Handle both positive and negative numbers, ensuring that negative values are properly represented.
4. Reverse the string since the remainder of divisions is stored in reverse order.
5. Add a null terminator at the end of the string.

## Expected Outcome
The function `itob` should correctly convert integers into strings representing the number in any base from 2 to 16, with correct handling of both positive and negative integers.
