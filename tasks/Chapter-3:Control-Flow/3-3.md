# Exercise 3-3: Expand Shorthand Notation

## Task
Write a function `expand(s1, s2)` that expands shorthand notations like `a-z` in `s1` into the full sequence `abc...xyz` in `s2`. The function should handle:
- Both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Digit ranges like `0-9`.
- Edge cases such as `a-b-c`, `a-z0-9`, and `-a-z`, ensuring leading or trailing `-` is treated literally.

## Steps
1. Parse `s1` and identify valid shorthand ranges.
2. Expand recognized patterns into their full sequences.
3. Handle edge cases correctly.
4. Store the result in `s2` and test with various inputs.

## Expected Outcome
The function should accurately expand shorthand notations while correctly handling edge cases.
