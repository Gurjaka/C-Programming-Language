# Exercise 3-1: Optimized Binary Search

## Task
Modify binary search to perform only one test inside the loop instead of two. Move any necessary checks outside the loop.

## Steps
1. Reduce the number of tests inside the loop.
2. Add required checks outside the loop.
3. Measure and compare execution time with the original.

## Expected Outcome
Analyze whether the optimization improves performance.
