# Exercise 5-16: Add the `-d` Option for Directory Order Sorting

## Task
Modify the `sort` program to handle a `-d` flag, which makes comparisons based only on letters, numbers, and blanks (spaces). When the `-d` flag is used, non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation) should be ignored during sorting. Ensure that the `-d` flag works correctly in conjunction with the `-f` flag (folding case).

## Steps
1. **Understand the Current Functionality of the `sort` Program**:
   - The `sort` program, as it stands, compares all characters in the input strings, including punctuation and special characters, when performing the sort.

2. **Implement the `-d` Flag**:
   - The `-d` flag should modify the sorting mechanism so that only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and spaces are considered in comparisons. All other characters, such as punctuation, should be ignored during the sorting process.
   - This means that characters such as punctuation marks ('!', '@', '#', etc.) should not affect the order in which strings are sorted.

3. **Handle the `-f` Flag Together with `-d`**:
   - When both `-d` and `-f` are used together, the program should first ignore non-alphanumeric characters as specified by the `-d` flag and then perform a case-insensitive comparison as specified by the `-f` flag.
   - For example, `sort -d -f` should treat 'a' and 'A' as equal while also ignoring non-alphanumeric characters in the sorting process.

4. **Sorting Mechanism**:
   - When `-d` is used, ensure that non-alphanumeric characters are ignored for comparison purposes.
   - After filtering the non-alphanumeric characters, proceed with sorting the input normally, considering the remaining characters (letters, numbers, and spaces).
   - If `-f` is also used, fold case after ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where the input contains various non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation or symbols).
   - Ensure the program correctly handles multiple flags (`-d`, `-f`, `-r`, `-n`) together.
   - Test the program with strings that contain spaces, mixed-case letters, and punctuation.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the program with input strings containing punctuation to ensure that only letters, numbers, and spaces are considered during the sorting process.
   - Test combinations of the `-d` and `-f` flags to verify that both options work together correctly.
   - Test the program with mixed-case input and strings containing special characters, ensuring proper handling of the `-d` and `-f` flags.
   - Test with a variety of non-alphanumeric characters to verify that they are properly ignored.

## Expected Outcome
The `sort` program should correctly handle the `-d` flag by ignoring non-alphanumeric characters during sorting. The program should sort alphabetically or numerically (depending on the flags used) while considering only letters, numbers, and spaces. The program should also handle combinations of the `-d` and `-f` flags appropriately, folding case when `-f` is used while ignoring non-alphanumeric characters with `-d`.
