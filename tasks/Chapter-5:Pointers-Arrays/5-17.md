## Task
Modify the `sort` program to add a field-searching capability, allowing sorting to be done on specific fields within lines. Each field should be sorted according to an independent set of options. For example, when sorting an index, the fields could be sorted with `-df` for the index category and `-n` for the page numbers.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Existing Sorting Functionality**:
   - Currently, the `sort` program sorts entire lines based on the entire line content, using options like `-f` (fold case) and `-n` (numerical sorting).
   
2. **Add Field-Splitting Capability**:
   - Modify the program so that it can recognize different fields in each line (e.g., separating fields by spaces or a specific delimiter such as tabs or commas).
   - Allow the user to specify which field(s) to sort by, similar to how the `cut` command works in Unix-based systems, by either specifying field indexes or delimiters.

3. **Support Independent Sorting for Each Field**:
   - For each specified field, allow the user to apply different sorting options.
     - For example, `-df` for sorting index categories (case insensitive, ignoring non-alphabetical characters) and `-n` for sorting page numbers numerically.
   - Implement the logic to process each field with its own set of sorting options, such as:
     - `-d`: Directory order (ignores non-alphanumeric characters).
     - `-f`: Fold case (case-insensitive sorting).
     - `-n`: Numeric sorting.
     - Other relevant options that may apply to specific fields.
   
4. **Handle Multiple Fields and Sorting Options**:
   - The user should be able to specify different sorting options for different fields. For instance:
     - `sort -k1,1 -n -k2,2 -df`: Sort by the first field numerically, and by the second field alphabetically with directory order and case-insensitivity.
   - Ensure that the `-k` flag can specify the range of fields to consider when sorting (e.g., `-k1,1` for the first field, `-k2,2` for the second field).

5. **Implement Field Indexing**:
   - Use the `-k` flag to specify which field should be sorted, allowing the user to provide indexes for multiple fields, such as `-k1` for the first field and `-k2` for the second field.
   - Ensure that fields are indexed starting from 1 (standard practice).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that the program correctly handles cases where fields are missing or where there are irregular field delimiters.
   - Handle input lines where there are different numbers of fields, making sure the sorting continues correctly for the specified fields.

7. **Testing**:
   - Test the program with input lines having multiple fields (e.g., name and page number), ensuring each field is sorted according to its own set of options.
   - Test with different combinations of sorting options, including `-d`, `-f`, and `-n`, applied to different fields.
   - Verify that the sorting respects the field indices and sorting options properly.

## Expected Outcome
The `sort` program should support sorting on specific fields within lines. Each field should be sortable according to an independent set of options (e.g., case-insensitive alphabetical sorting for one field and numerical sorting for another). The program should handle multiple fields and sorting options efficiently, allowing flexible sorting tailored to different data formats, such as index entries and page numbers.

The final output should correctly reflect the sorting order for each field based on the specified options, and the program should be robust against missing fields or irregular field delimiters.
