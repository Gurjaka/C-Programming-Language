## Task
Write versions of the library functions `strncpy`, `strncat`, and `strncmp`, which operate on at most the first `n` characters of their argument strings.

## Steps
1. **`strncpy(s, t, n)`**:
   - The function should copy at most `n` characters from string `t` to string `s`.
   - If `t` is shorter than `n`, the function should pad the remaining characters in `s` with null characters `'\0'` to ensure that `s` is always null-terminated.
   - If `t` is longer than `n`, only the first `n` characters should be copied.
   
2. **`strncat(s, t, n)`**:
   - The function should append at most `n` characters from string `t` to the end of string `s`.
   - The function should ensure that `s` is null-terminated after the append operation.
   - If `t` is shorter than `n`, append only the characters from `t` and null-terminate `s` appropriately.

3. **`strncmp(s, t, n)`**:
   - The function should compare the first `n` characters of strings `s` and `t`.
   - It should return:
     - `0` if the first `n` characters of `s` and `t` are the same.
     - A positive value if the first differing character in `s` is greater than the corresponding character in `t`.
     - A negative value if the first differing character in `s` is smaller than the corresponding character in `t`.

4. Test all three functions with various cases:
   - Copying and concatenating strings of different lengths.
   - Comparing strings of different lengths with different characters.
   - Handling edge cases like empty strings or strings shorter than `n`.

## Expected Outcome
Each function should behave as follows:
- `strncpy` copies at most `n` characters, padding with `'\0'` if necessary.
- `strncat` appends at most `n` characters, ensuring the string is null-terminated.
- `strncmp` compares at most `n` characters and returns the appropriate comparison result.
