## Task
Modify the `undcl` (undecorator) function to avoid adding redundant parentheses when converting C declarations. The goal is to ensure that the generated declaration is as simple and readable as possible, without unnecessary parentheses.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Existing `undcl` Function**:
   - The current implementation of `undcl` parses decorated declarations (such as function pointers) and converts them back to their original, more readable C declaration format.
   - This function is likely adding redundant parentheses when handling certain complex declarations, such as function pointers or pointer-to-pointer types.

2. **Identify Where Redundant Parentheses Are Added**:
   - Review the current `undcl` implementation and determine where unnecessary parentheses are being added. Common situations where this occurs include:
     - Pointer types with multiple levels of indirection.
     - Function pointer declarations where parentheses are used unnecessarily.

3. **Modify the Parsing Logic**:
   - Implement a strategy that avoids adding parentheses when they are not needed.
     - For example, function pointers like `int (*f())()` should be converted without excessive parentheses, ideally as `int (*f)()`.
     - Similarly, pointer declarations like `int **x` should not have redundant parentheses.

4. **Handle Complex Types**:
   - Modify the `undcl` function to correctly handle complex types (such as function pointers or multiple levels of pointer indirection) without adding unnecessary parentheses.
   - Implement checks to detect when parentheses are needed and when they can be safely omitted.

5. **Test the Function**:
   - Test the modified `undcl` function with a variety of declarations, both simple and complex. Ensure that:
     - Parentheses are only added where required by the C syntax.
     - Redundant parentheses are avoided.
   
6. **Refactor the Code**:
   - Once the logic is updated to avoid redundant parentheses, clean up the code and ensure that it remains readable and efficient.
   - Consider adding helper functions to handle specific cases of pointer or function declarations, which will make the code more modular.

7. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - Consider edge cases, such as declarations with a mix of pointers, arrays, and functions, and ensure that they are correctly handled without adding unnecessary parentheses.

8. **Test with Valid Input**:
   - Ensure that the function still works correctly with valid input and produces the expected, readable output without redundant parentheses.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `undcl` function should generate C declarations that are as simple as possible, removing redundant parentheses where they are not required by the syntax. It should handle all types of declarations correctly, including function pointers and pointers to pointers, without introducing unnecessary complexity in the output.

The final result should be a cleaner, more readable output for C declarations, which improves the maintainability and clarity of the code.
