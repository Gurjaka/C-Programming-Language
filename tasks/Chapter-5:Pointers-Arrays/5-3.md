# Exercise 5-3: Writing a Pointer Version of strcat

## Task
Write a pointer version of the function `strcat` that copies the string `t` to the end of string `s`.

## Steps
1. Review the current `strcat` implementation, which appends the string `t` to the end of string `s`. The pointer version of the function will rely on pointer arithmetic instead of array indexing.
2. Implement the `strcat` function that:
   - Takes two strings, `s` and `t`.
   - Uses pointers to navigate through both strings: one pointer for traversing `s` and another for copying `t` to the end of `s`.
   - Ensures the null-terminating character `'\0'` is correctly placed at the end of the concatenated string.
3. Test the function with various strings to ensure it works correctly, including cases where `s` is empty or `t` is empty.

## Expected Outcome
The pointer version of `strcat` should correctly append the string `t` to the end of `s`, updating `s` in place. The function should efficiently traverse both strings using pointers and handle edge cases like empty strings correctly.
