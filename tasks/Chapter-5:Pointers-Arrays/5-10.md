# Exercise 5-10: Reverse Polish Expression Evaluator

## Task
Write a program `expr` that evaluates a reverse Polish expression from the command line. Each operator or operand should be a separate argument. For example: `$ expr 2 3 + 4 *`

This should evaluate the expression `(2 + 3) * 4`, which equals `20`.

## Steps
1. **Understand Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**:
   - In Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), operators follow their operands. For example, the expression `2 3 +` means "add 2 and 3".
   - The operands are pushed onto a stack, and when an operator is encountered, it operates on the most recent operands on the stack.

2. **Implementing the `expr` Program**:
   - Parse the command line arguments (each operand or operator is a separate argument).
   - Use a stack to store operands. When an operator is encountered, pop the necessary operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
   - Handle basic arithmetic operations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
   - Ensure the program handles errors, such as invalid expressions or unsupported operators.

3. **Handling Operands and Operators**:
   - For each argument in the command line:
     - If it's a number, push it onto the stack.
     - If it's an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), pop the appropriate operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all arguments, the stack should contain one element, which is the result of the expression. Print this value.
   - If the stack does not have exactly one element at the end, the input expression was invalid.

5. **Test the Program**:
   - Test the program with various RPN expressions, including:
     - Simple operations: `expr 2 3 +`
     - Multiple operations: `expr 2 3 + 4 *`
     - Division and subtraction: `expr 10 2 / 3 +`
   - Handle edge cases like division by zero, invalid operations, or incorrect number of operands.

## Expected Outcome
The `expr` program should evaluate valid reverse Polish expressions correctly, printing the result. It should also handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input or unsupported operations, and provide an appropriate error message.
