## Task
Extend the `entab` and `detab` programs to accept the shorthand `+n` as an argument, where `n` is the tab stop. The `+n` shorthand will add a tab stop at column `n`, and the program should accept multiple `+n` arguments. If no arguments are provided, use the default tab settings.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Functionality of `entab` and `detab`**:
   - `entab` replaces sequences of spaces with tab characters where possible, based on tab stops.
   - `detab` replaces tab characters with spaces, again based on tab stops.

2. **Accepting the `+n` Argument**:
   - Modify both programs to accept tab stops using the `+n` shorthand, where `n` is the column number of the tab stop.
   - The programs should accept multiple `+n` arguments, which specify the positions of the tab stops.
   - If no arguments are provided, the programs should fall back to using default tab settings (e.g., every 8th column).

3. **Modify `entab`**:
   - When a sequence of spaces is encountered, check if the spaces can be replaced with a tab character, based on the tab stops (which include the default settings and any additional ones provided by the `+n` arguments).
   - Ensure that the tab stop list is sorted for easier checking of the appropriate stop position.

4. **Modify `detab`**:
   - When a tab character is encountered, replace it with the appropriate number of spaces based on the tab stop positions (including those specified by the `+n` arguments).
   - For each tab character, calculate the number of spaces needed to reach the next tab stop and replace the tab accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where tab stops might overlap or where tabs exceed the specified column limits.
   - Ensure that the input is properly parsed and the programs handle multiple `+n` arguments correctly.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the extended versions of `entab` and `detab` with multiple `+n` arguments to ensure that the program behaves as expected.
   - Test with no arguments to confirm that the default tab settings are used.
   - Test edge cases where the tab stops are near or beyond the length of a line.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `entab` and `detab` programs should handle the shorthand `+n` correctly, allowing users to define custom tab stops on the command line. The programs should replace spaces with tabs and tabs with spaces based on the specified tab stop positions, defaulting to standard tab stops when
