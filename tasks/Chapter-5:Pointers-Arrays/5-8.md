# Exercise 5-8: Adding Error Checking to day_of_year and month_day

## Task
The functions `day_of_year` and `month_day` lack error checking. Add error checking to these functions to handle invalid inputs such as out-of-range months, days, or invalid values.

## Steps
1. **Review the `day_of_year` Function**:
   - This function converts a given date (month and day) to the corresponding day of the year.
   - The function currently assumes valid month and day values.
   - Modify the function to check if the month is within the range `1` to `12`, and if the day is valid for the given month (taking into account leap years for February).

2. **Add Error Checking to `day_of_year`**:
   - Ensure that the month is between `1` and `12`.
   - Ensure the day is valid for the given month, taking into account the number of days in each month. February should have `28` or `29` days depending on whether it's a leap year.
   - If the month or day is invalid, return an error or an indication of failure (such as `-1`).

3. **Review the `month_day` Function**:
   - This function converts a day of the year to the corresponding month and day.
   - It assumes the input day is within the valid range for the given year.
   - Modify the function to check if the day is valid, i.e., it should be between `1` and `365` (or `1` and `366` for leap years).

4. **Add Error Checking to `month_day`**:
   - Ensure that the input day is within the range `1` to `365` for a common year, or `1` to `366` for a leap year.
   - If the day is invalid, return an error or an indication of failure (such as `-1`).
   - Handle edge cases like leap years when determining the number of days in February.

5. **Test the Functions**:
   - Test the `day_of_year` function with valid and invalid inputs, such as months outside the range or invalid days (e.g., the 31st day in a month with only 30 days).
   - Test the `month_day` function with valid and invalid day numbers, ensuring that it handles edge cases like leap years and invalid day inputs.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `day_of_year` and `month_day` functions should handle invalid inputs gracefully by checking for errors and returning appropriate error indicators (e.g., `-1` or another error code). The error checking will ensure that the functions do not produce incorrect results or cause crashes when given invalid data.
