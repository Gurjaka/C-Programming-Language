# Exercise 5-15: Add the Option `-f` to Fold Case During Sorting

## Task
Modify the `sort` program to handle a `-f` flag, which folds upper and lower case characters together. This means that case distinctions will not be considered during sorting; for example, 'a' and 'A' should compare as equal.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Current Functionality of the `sort` Program**:
   - The `sort` program, without the `-f` flag, distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters when sorting. For example, 'A' is considered smaller than 'a'.

2. **Implement the `-f` Flag**:
   - The `-f` flag should make the sorting case-insensitive by treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equal.
   - To achieve this, convert all characters to the same case (either upper or lower) before performing the sorting. This can be done by converting the entire string to lowercase or uppercase for comparison during the sort.

3. **Handle Multiple Flags**:
   - Ensure that the program can handle multiple flags together, including combinations of `-f`, `-r`, and `-n`.
   - For example, the command `sort -f -r` should fold case and sort the lines in reverse order, while `sort -f -n` should fold case and sort numerically.

4. **Sorting Mechanism**:
   - When the `-f` flag is used, convert all characters to a consistent case (e.g., lowercase) for comparison purposes.
   - For numeric sorting (`-n`), still handle the sorting numerically while ignoring case distinctions for any string-based comparisons.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where the input contains mixed case or non-alphabetic characters (numbers, symbols, etc.).
   - Ensure the program doesn't break or provide incorrect output when both `-f` and `-n` flags are used together.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the program with mixed-case input to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive.
   - Test combinations of the `-f`, `-r`, and `-n` flags to verify that the sorting is performed correctly with these options.
   - Test with input containing numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase letters to ensure the case-insensitivity is applied correctly.

## Expected Outcome
The `sort` program should correctly handle the `-f` flag by folding case distinctions, ensuring that uppercase and lowercase characters are treated as equal during sorting. The program should sort alphabetically or numerically (depending on the flags used) while ignoring case differences. The program should also handle combinations of the `-f`, `-r`, and `-n` flags appropriately.
