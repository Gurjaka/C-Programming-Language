## Task
Write the function `strend(s, t)`, which returns `1` if the string `t` occurs at the end of the string `s`, and `0` otherwise.

## Steps
1. Understand that the goal is to check if the string `t` is a suffix of the string `s`. This means `t` should appear at the end of `s`, starting from the last character of `s`.
2. Implement the `strend` function:
   - The function should take two strings, `s` and `t`.
   - It should check if the length of `t` is less than or equal to the length of `s`. If not, return `0` immediately.
   - Use a loop or pointer arithmetic to compare the last `n` characters of `s` (where `n` is the length of `t`) with `t`.
   - If all characters match, return `1`; otherwise, return `0`.
3. Test the function with various cases, including when `t` is empty, `s` is empty, and when `t` exactly matches the end of `s`.

## Expected Outcome
The `strend` function should return `1` if the string `t` occurs at the end of string `s`, and `0` otherwise. The function should handle various edge cases, such as empty strings, correctly.
