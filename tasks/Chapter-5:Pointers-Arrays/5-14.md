## Task
Modify the `sort` program to handle a `-r` flag, which indicates sorting in reverse (decreasing) order. Ensure that the `-r` flag works in conjunction with the `-n` flag, which sorts the input numerically.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Current Functionality of the `sort` Program**:
   - The `sort` program typically sorts input lines in ascending (alphabetical) order. The `-n` flag modifies this to sort numerically.
   
2. **Implement the `-r` Flag**:
   - The `-r` flag should reverse the order of the sorted lines, so that the output is sorted in decreasing order.
   - If the user provides both `-r` and `-n`, the program should first sort the numbers in ascending order and then reverse the output to make it decreasing.

3. **Handle Multiple Flags**:
   - Ensure that the program can correctly handle both the `-n` and `-r` flags together. The `-n` flag should sort the input numerically, and the `-r` flag should reverse the sorted output.
   - For example, the command `sort -r -n` should sort numerically in reverse order.

4. **Sorting Mechanism**:
   - When sorting numerically with `-n`, ensure that the sorting algorithm interprets the lines as numbers.
   - For the reverse order (`-r`), modify the sorting logic to invert the order of the sorted lines after the sorting is done.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle edge cases where the input might contain a mix of numbers and non-numeric values.
   - Consider what should happen if the user specifies invalid combinations of flags or invalid input.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test with different combinations of flags (`-n`, `-r`, or both) to ensure that the program behaves as expected.
   - Test with numerical input to ensure the program correctly sorts numbers in reverse order.
   - Test with non-numeric input to ensure the program handles it correctly (either by sorting alphabetically or providing an error).

## Expected Outcome
The `sort` program should correctly handle the `-r` flag for reverse sorting, both independently and in combination with the `-n` flag. The program should sort the input in descending order when `-r` is used and should sort numerically when `-n` is used, with both flags working together as expected.
