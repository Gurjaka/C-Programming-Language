## Task
As written, `getint` treats a `+` or `-` sign not followed by a digit as a valid representation of zero. Fix it to push such a character back on the input.

## Steps
1. Review the current behavior of the `getint` function, specifically how it processes the `+` and `-` signs. The function currently allows these signs without any digits following them, treating them as zero.
2. Modify the logic to check whether the `+` or `-` is followed by a valid digit. If it isn't, the function should push the character back onto the input buffer, indicating that it is not a valid number representation.
3. Implement a condition to handle this check in the input processing flow.
4. Use `ungetch` or a similar mechanism to push the invalid `+` or `-` character back onto the input buffer for further handling.
5. Test the updated `getint` function with different input cases, including valid and invalid uses of the `+` and `-` symbols.

## Expected Outcome
The `getint` function should now correctly handle cases where a `+` or `-` is not followed by a digit. In such cases, the function should push the invalid character back onto the input buffer and not treat it as a valid representation of zero.
