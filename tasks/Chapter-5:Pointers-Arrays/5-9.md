# Exercise 5-9: Rewriting day_of_year and month_day with Pointers

## Task
Rewrite the functions `day_of_year` and `month_day` to use pointers instead of array indexing for accessing the months and days.

## Steps
1. **Review the Original Functions**:
   - In the original `day_of_year` and `month_day` functions, array indexing is used to access the days in each month and to perform calculations.
   - The task is to modify these functions to use pointers, eliminating the need for array indexing.

2. **Rewrite `day_of_year` Using Pointers**:
   - The function `day_of_year` takes a month and a day and returns the corresponding day of the year.
   - Instead of indexing into an array for the number of days in each month, modify the function to use a pointer to traverse through the months and sum the days up to the given month.
   - This may involve using a pointer to a statically defined array or another appropriate data structure for storing the number of days in each month.

3. **Rewrite `month_day` Using Pointers**:
   - The function `month_day` takes the day of the year and returns the corresponding month and day.
   - Instead of using array indexing to calculate the month and day, modify the function to use a pointer to traverse the months and find the correct month and day.

4. **Handle Leap Years**:
   - Both functions should still account for leap years when working with February (having 29 days in leap years).
   - The pointer-based version of the functions should incorporate this logic as in the original functions.

5. **Test the Functions**:
   - Test the pointer-based versions of `day_of_year` and `month_day` to ensure they behave as expected for both valid and invalid inputs.
   - Ensure the functions correctly handle edge cases, including leap years.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `day_of_year` and `month_day` functions should now use pointers for accessing and manipulating the months and days, rather than array indexing. The functionality should remain the same as the original versions, and the pointer-based approach should achieve the same results in a more pointer-centric manner.
