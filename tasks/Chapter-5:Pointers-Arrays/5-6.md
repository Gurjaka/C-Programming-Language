# Exercise 5-6: Rewriting Programs Using Pointers Instead of Array Indexing

## Task
Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises using pointers instead of array indexing. Some good candidates include `getline` (Chapters 1 and 4), `atoi`, `itoa`, and their variants (Chapters 2, 3, and 4), `reverse` (Chapter 3), and `strindex` and `getop` (Chapter 4).

## Steps
1. **Identify Programs to Rewrite**:
   - Review previous exercises and identify programs that use array indexing to manipulate strings or perform computations.
   - Consider the following functions:
     - `getline`: This function reads a line of input and can be rewritten to use pointers for navigating through the string.
     - `atoi`: The function that converts a string to an integer can be rewritten using pointers to traverse through the string and perform the conversion.
     - `itoa`: This function converts an integer to a string, and the conversion can be done using pointers to fill the string in reverse order.
     - `reverse`: A function to reverse a string can use pointer manipulation to swap characters at both ends of the string.
     - `strindex`: A function that finds the position of a substring in a string can be rewritten using pointers to traverse through the strings.
     - `getop`: The function that retrieves an operator or number from input can be rewritten to use pointers for processing the input characters.

2. **Rewriting the Programs**:
   - For each program, replace array indexing with pointer arithmetic. This means:
     - Using pointers to access array elements (e.g., `*(ptr + i)` instead of `arr[i]`).
     - Iterating through arrays or strings using pointer increments (e.g., `ptr++` instead of `i++`).
     - Be mindful of the pointer's position and ensure null-termination is handled correctly for string operations.
   
3. **Test the Rewritten Programs**:
   - After modifying the programs, thoroughly test them to ensure that they still function as expected.
   - Test edge cases, such as empty strings, large inputs, and strings with special characters.
   
## Expected Outcome
Each of the rewritten programs should work correctly with pointers instead of array indexing. The functionality should remain the same, but the code will use pointer arithmetic for array and string manipulation.
