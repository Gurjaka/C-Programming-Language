## Task
Write `getfloat`, the floating-point analog of `getint`. What type does `getfloat` return as its function value?

## Steps
1. Understand the `getint` function, which reads an integer from input. `getfloat` will work similarly, but it will need to handle floating-point numbers.
2. Implement the `getfloat` function to read and process a floating-point number from input. It should handle signs, digits before and after the decimal point, and an optional exponent part.
3. Ensure that `getfloat` handles edge cases such as:
   - A number with no digits after the decimal point (e.g., `3.`).
   - A number with a leading decimal point (e.g., `.25`).
   - An exponent part in scientific notation (e.g., `1.23e4`).
   - Invalid inputs like `+.` or `-.` that should be treated as errors.
4. Use a suitable floating-point type (`float` or `double`) to store the value that `getfloat` reads.
5. Test `getfloat` with various inputs, including edge cases like large numbers, small numbers, and invalid floating-point representations.

## Expected Outcome
The `getfloat` function should correctly read and process floating-point numbers from input, handling various formats such as integers, decimal points, and scientific notation. It should return the floating-point number read as its value, typically using `float` or `double` as the return type.
