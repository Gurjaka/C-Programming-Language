# Exercise 5-7: Rewriting readlines to Use a Supplied Array

## Task
Rewrite the `readlines` function to store lines in an array supplied by `main`, rather than calling `alloc` to maintain storage. Measure how much faster the program is after the modification.

## Steps
1. **Review the Original readlines Function**:
   - In the original implementation, `readlines` dynamically allocates memory to store each line of input using `alloc`.
   - The task is to modify this function so that it uses an array provided by `main` instead of dynamically allocating memory for each line.

2. **Modify the Function to Use a Supplied Array**:
   - In the `main` function, define an array large enough to hold all the lines that will be read.
   - Pass this array to the `readlines` function, which will now fill this pre-allocated array with the input lines.
   - Make sure to handle the array bounds to avoid overflowing the allocated space.
   - Update the logic of `readlines` to use the supplied array instead of dynamically allocating memory.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that the program works correctly for small inputs, large inputs, and edge cases (such as empty lines).
   - If there are more lines than the size of the array, the program should not crash or overwrite memory. Consider limiting the number of lines read based on the size of the array.

4. **Measure Performance**:
   - After making the changes, compare the speed of the modified program with the original version that uses dynamic memory allocation.
   - You can use a tool like `time` in a Unix-like environment to measure the runtime of the program and compare the results.
   - Consider testing with a large number of lines to observe a more noticeable difference in performance.

## Expected Outcome
The rewritten `readlines` function should store lines in an array provided by `main`, avoiding dynamic memory allocation. The program should function correctly and be more efficient because it no longer needs to call `alloc` to allocate memory for each line. The program's performance should improve, especially when handling large inputs, due to the removal of dynamic memory allocation overhead.
