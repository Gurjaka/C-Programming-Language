# Exercise 5-11: Modify `entab` and `detab` to Accept Custom Tab Stops

## Task
Modify the programs `entab` and `detab` (written as exercises in Chapter 1) to accept a list of tab stops as arguments. If no arguments are provided, use the default tab settings.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Existing `entab` and `detab` Programs**:
   - The `entab` program converts spaces to tab characters when possible, based on predefined tab stops.
   - The `detab` program converts tab characters to spaces, again based on predefined tab stops.
   
2. **Modify the Programs to Accept Tab Stops as Arguments**:
   - Modify both `entab` and `detab` to accept tab stop positions as command-line arguments.
   - If no arguments are given, the programs should default to the standard tab stop positions (e.g., every 8th column).
   
3. **Handle Tab Stops in `entab`**:
   - When encountering a sequence of spaces in the input, determine if a tab can replace the sequence of spaces based on the tab stop positions.
   - If a tab can be used (i.e., the number of spaces is equal to or exceeds the tab stop distance), replace the spaces with a tab.

4. **Handle Tab Stops in `detab`**:
   - When encountering a tab character, replace it with the appropriate number of spaces based on the tab stop positions.
   - For each tab character, calculate how many spaces are needed to reach the next tab stop, and replace the tab accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where the input text has more spaces or tabs than the defined tab stops.
   - Ensure that the programs handle multiple tab stops correctly, whether the positions are specified or the defaults are used.

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the modified programs with various tab stop settings.
   - Test with no arguments to ensure the default tab stops are used.
   - Test with different text inputs, including multiple spaces and tabs, to confirm correct behavior.

## Expected Outcome
The modified `entab` and `detab` programs should correctly handle custom tab stop settings, as well as default to standard tab stops when no custom positions are provided. The programs should properly convert spaces to tabs and tabs to spaces based on the given or default tab stops.
