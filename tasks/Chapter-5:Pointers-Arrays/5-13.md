## Task
Write the program `tail`, which prints the last `n` lines of its input. By default, `n` is set to 10, but it can be changed by an optional argument. If the argument is provided, `tail` should print the last `n` lines instead of the default 10.

## Steps
1. **Understand the Program Requirements**:
   - The program should read input and print the last `n` lines. If no argument is provided, it should print the last 10 lines by default.
   - The user should be able to specify a different number of lines using an optional argument.

2. **Read Input and Store Lines**:
   - Read all the input lines until the end. Store each line in a data structure such as a queue or circular buffer, which allows you to discard older lines when the buffer reaches a maximum size (`n`).
   
3. **Handle the Argument**:
   - If the user provides an argument specifying the number of lines (`n`), parse it and use it to determine how many lines to print.
   - If no argument is provided, default to 10 lines.

4. **Display the Last `n` Lines**:
   - Once the lines are stored, the program should print the last `n` lines. If the buffer reaches the limit, overwrite the oldest lines with new ones.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle the case where the input has fewer than `n` lines.
   - Handle invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values for `n` or negative values.
   
6. **Testing**:
   - Test with different values of `n` to ensure that the program prints the correct number of lines.
   - Test with input containing fewer than `n` lines to ensure that the program behaves as expected.
   - Ensure the program handles incorrect input gracefully.

## Expected Outcome
The `tail` program should print the last `n` lines of its input, with `n` being 10 by default unless specified otherwise by the user. The program should work efficiently, handling var
